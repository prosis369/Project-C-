A Food Ordering System

This is based on the concept of ordering food items and generating total food cost. The user has to provide the Login Details, which include Login ID and Password to access the menu of the system. The user can then see a menu which includes starters, main course and desserts with their costs. The user can choose an item based on the key and can change it if he/she wishes. Based on the requirement, more food can be ordered. Finally once the user is done with the ordering, the user is asked for his/her personal details which include name, phone number and address. The bill is then generated with the bill number, order number, name of the cashier, the food ordered, personal details of the user and the total bill amount.
